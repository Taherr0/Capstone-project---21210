            <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                From 90 million tons of solid waste annually, Egypt only recycles 12% of household 
                solid waste. This results in a huge amount of wasted materials and waste pollution. Thus, our 
                study aims to address the issues of electronic waste and the effective management of waste 
                resources. Using old waste materials, we seek to construct an effective 12V DC power supply to 
                meet lab requirements from E-waste materials working in at least 2 school labs with a maximum 
                error of ±5%. With a circuit board and key materials of a voltage regulator and a bridge rectifier, 
                which was constructed from old materials like fans and chargers. As a result, our project 
                succeeded in stabilizing production of output voltage across various loads with an average 
                efficiency of 72.5% and a maximum voltage of 40V. Also, our project shows low energy loss and 
                thermal efficiency with a maximum temperature difference of 27.5°C and a ripple of 0.36% at 
                100% load. Hence, our project shows a sustainable way to produce energy from e-waste in a 
                functional device unit.
