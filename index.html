                    I’m Taher Ahmed, a biomedical engineering research enthusiast with a strong passion for physics, calculus, and artificial intelligence. I am proud to be ranked within the top 3% internationally in the International Physics Realm, which reflects my dedication to deep analytical thinking and problem-solving. For this project, I contributed by designing the poster and building the project website, ensuring that both the visuals and the content communicated our ideas clearly. I also carefully edited the scientific writing of the poster to make it precise and professional, while actively participating in the research process to support the development and refinement of the project’s core concepts.

        <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            From 90 million tons of solid waste annually, Egypt only recycles 12% of household 
solid waste. This results in a huge amount of wasted materials and waste pollution. Thus, our 
study aims to address the issues of electronic waste and the effective management of waste 
resources. Using old waste materials, we seek to construct an effective 12V DC power supply to 
meet lab requirements from E-waste materials working in at least 2 school labs with a maximum 
error of ±5%. With a circuit board and key materials of a voltage regulator and a bridge rectifier, 
which was constructed from old materials like fans and chargers. As a result, our project 
succeeded in stabilizing production of output voltage across various loads with an average 
efficiency of 72.5% and a maximum voltage of 40V. Also, our project shows low energy loss and 
thermal efficiency with a maximum temperature difference of 27.5°C and a ripple of 0.36% at 
100% load. Hence, our project shows a sustainable way to produce energy from e-waste in a 
functional device unit. For future research, we recommend use a high efficiency switching 
regulator That is estimated to raise efficiency to 74.3%.
